# Multiple stressor gradient analysis

This repository contains the collection of 158 paired-stressor response cases, the modelling results, as well as the R-codes used in the study:

Mack et al. (in review). The length of stressor gradients affects observed multiple-stressor effects. 


1) The folder "All cases" includes the 158 paired-stressor response cases as semicolon-separated values and the file "01_Legend_CaseIDs.csv" specifying the column-headers. Note that the variable details are specified in the file "01_Metadata.csv". If you wish to use the data on individual cases, please use the contact listed in "01_Metadata.csv".

2) The folder "Metadata and results" includes

    a) the metadata and contacts/references for single cases ("01_Metadata.csv") and the file "01_Legend_Metadata.csv" specifying the column-headers, and   
    b) the modelling results of the study ("02_Modelling_results.csv") and the file "02_Legend_Modelling_results.csv" specifying the column-headers.

3) The folder "R_scripts" includes exemplary R-scripts on

    a) the initial linear regression analysis ("Linear_regression_example.html"), and    
    b) the stressor gradient split analysis ("Gradient_split_example.html").
